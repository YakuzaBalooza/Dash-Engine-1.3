# IMPORTANT
***This version of Dash Engine is NOT compatible with prior versions of the framework. Do not attempt to copy files from 1.3 to prior vrsions, as you're likely to encounter errors.***

***It is recommended to have some prior knowledge with navigating and using Unreal Engine 4 to get the most out of Dash 1.3.***

***Dash Engine 1.3 was developed using UE4 4.27 and as such is not compatible with other versions of Unreal.***

***Many particles in Dash Engine depend on the Cascade particle system, which is depricated in Unreal Engine 5. I myself will also have difficulty debugging and testing issues you may encounter with a UE5 compile due to me not using UE5 myself. As such, it is NOT recommended to use UE5 with Dash Engine.***

# Dash Engine 1.3

Welcome to Dash Engine 1.3!

Dash Engine is a framework developed in Unreal Engine 4 designed to give a starting point for developing Sonic fangames. It provides a lot of the basic necessities Sonic games have, such as slope physics, various skills like the Boost and Spindash, objects like Springs and Rings, and even a proper options menu!

Dash 1.3 comes with two characters to start with; Modern Sonic, a stiffer to control Sonic who uses skills like the Boost and Stomp to navigate with precision, and Adventure Sonic, a more freeflowing to control Sonic who uses slope physics in conjuction with the Spindash, Roll, and Dropdash to gain speed through the environment.

Of course, you don't have to stick with what's present in the base framework. Everything can be changed to your liking! The skills Sonic has, how objects look, to even adding entirely new objects and mechanics, the possabilities are endless!

# Setup/Installation

Dash Engine uses C++, and as such requires a unique compilation method. You can't open the project straight out the box sadly.

Luckily, there's a handy video to help you out!

***IMPORTANT TO NOTE:*** The above video by Nova was created back when Dash Engine 1.1 released. Dash 1.1 had a required step involving an executable called "dashgen.exe". This step is not required for Dash 1.2 and 1.3, and as such you should be able to ignore the dashgen.exe step and everything work fine. All other steps still apply.
